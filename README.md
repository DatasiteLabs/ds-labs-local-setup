# ds-labs-local-setup

General tools and/or setup scripts. This is a very base-level setup.

## Installing

I encourage you to view [the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DatasiteLabs/ds-labs-local-setup/HEAD/install.sh) in your browser before executing it.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DatasiteLabs/ds-labs-local-setup/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**NOTE**: during development of this script you may want to replace HEAD with the branch name to avoid caching/delays in updates. Opening a fresh terminal tab also helps.

### What the install script does

The general idea is the script checks for dependencies and installs or updates. The scripts should be idempotent, so you can run it multiple times.
